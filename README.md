Instructor Name: Tim Stacey

Office hours: TBA

Teaching Assistant: TBA

###  Course Description:
Natural Language Processing (**NLP**) is a quickly developing field, becoming incredibly crucial as many struggle to keep up with the deluge of text data created on the web. Text mining, as it is sometimes referred to, has taken many forms over the last ten years, and the field has experienced a seismic shift in methodology as deep learning and neural nets become more ubiquitous. 

### Learning Outcomes:
 As a result of completing this course, students will be able to:
 - Understand how to apply natural language processing to real world problems
 - Understand the basics of neural network architecture for NLP
 - Be able to build a neural network to execute a variety of NLP related tasks
 - Gain experience with popular Python libraries for both NLP and deep learning

### Course Prerequisite:
You are expected to have a basic understanding of Python, linear algebra, and probability.

### Tentative Schedule:
This is a tentative schedule, and subject to change. Please check here regularly for updates.

### Learning Assignments:
#### In-Class Exercise:
 These assessments will be used to check learning and give feedback on areas for improvement. Reading prior to class, class attendance, and participation in activities are essential for success on this part of the course.
#### Homework Assignments:
 Details on requirements will be given during class periods. Most assignments will be due the next class period and can be submitted via blackboard. We will work to provide feedback at the next class session. 
#### Class Projects: 
Two group projects will be assigned over the semester to give students practice on applying data science principles and methods to various problems. Students will also build teamwork, communication, and technical skills.
#### Quizzes: 
Two quizzes will be given to ensure students are gaining knowledge and doing out of class readings 

### Grading:
Your final grade will be determined by:
 - Assignments (25%) 
 - Quizzes (25%) 
 - Project I (25%) 
 - Project II (25%)

#### Grading Scale:
